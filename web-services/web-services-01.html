                <h3>Web Services</h3>
                <p class="p">Web service is a standardized medium to propagate communication between the client and server applications on the World Wide Web.It is a software system for the interoperable machine to machine communication. A web service is a software module that is designed to perform a certain set of tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    + The web services can be searched for over the network and can also be invoked accordingly. <br>
                    + When invoked, the web service would be able to provide the functionality to the client, which invokes that web service.
                </p>
                <h4>Working of Web Service</h4>

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>The above diagram shows a very simplistic view of how a web service would actually work. The client would invoke a series of web service calls via requests to a server which would host the actual web service.</p>
                <h4>Need of Web Service</h4>
                <p>
                    Modern day business applications use variety of programming platforms to develop web-based applications. Some applications may be developed in Java, others in .Net, while some other in Angular JS, Node.js, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most often than not, these heterogeneous applications need some sort of communication to happen between them. Since they are built using different development languages, it becomes really difficult to ensure accurate communication between applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is where web services come in. Web services provide a common platform that allows multiple applications built on various programming languages to have the ability to communicate with each other.
                </p>
                <h4>Type of Web Services :</h4>
                <p>There are mainly two types of web services. <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>SOAP Web Services</li>
                        <li>RESTful Web Services</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
